- **Typescript**: TypeScript is a superset for adding typesetting to JavaScript which aims to improve the development process by improving the IDE's intelliSense and preventing bugs.
- **Redux**: a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server and native) and are easy to test; 
- **Redux Saga**: a library that aims to make application side effects easier to manage, more efficient to run, easier to test and better at handling crashes;
- **Axios**:  a Promises-based HTTP client for Browser and NodeJS;
- **Tailwind CSS**: a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces;
